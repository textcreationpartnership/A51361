            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47548:3"/>might have more ample and ſpeciall matter every way to preſent, and not appeare emptie handed before you.</p>
            <p>Now Gods judgements are growne to a great ripeneſſe, or (to ſpeake with alluſion to our bleſſed Saviours expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in a like caſe) The figtree hath budded whereby men may know Summer is nigh. Wherefore, if your Royall Majeſty, and the high Court of Parliament, will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make a due enquiry and examination of my courſe, whereby the matter of fact may bee authentically made knowne; and then caſt a ſerious eye upon the publicke events of the divine providence, which (ſucceeding in due conformity and conſequence this many yeares, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the approved teſtimonies of Gods ſpeciall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ancient times) are as it were, the great broad Seal of heaven, giving weight and authority to my words, and endeavours; beſides that your Majeſty may with eaſe ſee that there is a ſupernaturall order of things, taught by ſupernaturall faith (which one not many yeares ſince in a publique printed booke dedicated to your Highneſſe, hath endeavoured to evacuate) you may moreover with like facility perceive how the ſacred decrees of Gods heavenly providence are drawne up, not onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſt of the Chriſtian world, but alſo eſpecially concerning you and your Kingdome, and by conforming your ſelfe to his holy will, decline the common miſchiefs approaching, which otherwiſe by no humane meanes can poſſibly be avoided.</p>
            <p>Let not my meanneſſe (who am but an unworthy inſtrument, and the leaſt of your Majeſties ſubjects) move your Highneſſe, or the grave aſſembly of Parliament to diſpiſe the offer which I make, but firſt enquire, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine diligently (as both Gods Law and mans reaſon do enquire) and then judge. There are ſome dangers which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47548:3"/>can neither be knowne, nor avoyded, unleſſe they be firſt gratiouſly diſcovered by ſome ſpeciall favour and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt cauſe which is God himſelfe, from whom nothing can be hid, and in ſuch caſes, though his divine Majeſtie doth many times imploy men of great wiſedome and ſanctitie (as he did the Prophet <hi>Elizeus</hi> to diſcover to the King of Iſrael the ambuſhments ſet to entrap him by the King of Syria) yet he doth ſometimes alſo, not onely uſe the moſt contemptible of men, as inſtruments to make the greateſt potentates acquainted with his wayes, and ſo enable them to avoid prepared miſchiefes, but moreover taketh a brute beaſt for the like purpoſe, as in the caſe of <hi>Balaam</hi> and his Aſſe.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſties great predeceſſor <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour thought it wiſedome, in a certain occaſion, to hearken to the advertiſement even of a naturall foole, as we reade in our Chronicles: and long before his time, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great gave eare to a woman, who was thought diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as <hi>Curtius</hi> the Hiſtorian doth teſtifie; by which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie credulity (God, who is al able to make fooles and mad men ſpeake his wiſedome, having diſcovered his divine knowledge and judgement by meanes of thoſe ſilly ones) thoſe two great Princes avoyded imminent danger of death, and conſerved their lives, and fortunes, for their great ſucceeding victories. On the otherſide, the neglect of timely advertiſements, hath brought many great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and amongſt the reſt, that great Monarch <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> to the loſſe of their Crownes and lives. <hi>Hee that will not hearken to God in his gracious ſignes and forewarnings, muſt feele his heavy hand when it will be too late to avoid it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For me I doe not profeſſe my ſelfe among the number of wiſe men, and if your Majeſty, or the great aſſembly of State now on foot, pleaſe, you may take mee for a foole,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47548:4"/>or a mad man (provided you acknowledge, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty can by his holy overruling Spirit, make a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe prodigious, and ſo uſe the folly or madneſſe of his creature, as an inſtrument to expreſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One thing I muſt crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of your Royall Majeſty, and the great Aſſembly of Parliament; that I addreſſe my ſelfe thus to you in print, before I have acquainted you with my caſe in a more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way.
